We often treat time as a universal, objective measure, but for each of us, any given time can mean something entirely different…a looming deadline, a quiet moment of creation, or the start of a new adventure. This installation features clocks gracefully surrendering to their own temporal nature, their forms melting and shifting in a beautiful dissolution.\n\nThese aren\'t instruments to tell the hour, but rather a visual paradox. They embody time as a human-made construct that relentlessly dictates our lives, yet paradoxically, holds no ultimate dominion beyond our individual perception. As you encounter these fluid forms, consider the profound freedom in realizing time\'s ultimate fluidity and its subjective grip.\n\nWitness the unraveling of the clock and perhaps find your own moment outside of "when." Let\'s ignore the question of what time is it, and simply be here now, embracing the immediacy of this very moment.',
